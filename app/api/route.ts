  const summary = `Have you ever thought How this Rs. 4 Pan Masala can cast expensive actors  like Ajay Devgan, SRK, Akshay Kumar? How can they afford this? I mean this Kesar Elaichi industry How much do these companies earn? This industry makes such colourful products But do we even know how big it is? Even I didn't know But after I found out the answer So today, let us learn The video is quite interesting So please watch it till the end And if you understood the point of this video Please share the video with your friends My first question How can Pan Masala companies afford these big stars? Pan Masala companies sponsor film awards They print full page ads in major newspapers And even their 30 second ad shoots are done in foreign locations Doing all of this requires money And all these brands can easily afford this  the Pan Masala market in India is worth Rs. 41,000 crores! To put things in perspective The chocolates market in India is Rs. 16,000 crores The biscuit market in India is Rs. 37,000 crores Big stars will charge Rs. 10 crore for an ad For a Rs. 41,000 crore industry this sum is only 0.02% India leads the world in Pan Masala export And the biggest importer is UAE India's tobacco industry employs 4.5 crore people My second question is Is it legal to sell people cancer? The World Health Organization says 10 crore people die of tobacco related cancers This number will rise to 100 crores in the 21st century You must have seen those ads before a movie begins Cancer has a relation to these addictive products You don't need to be a scientist to understand that You just need to go to a theatre and watch a movie In spite of the obvious links to cancer this Rs. 41,000 crore industry keeps growing But how? Because the industry is a genius They're a genius in marketing You can't promote tobacco in India After 2011 All states banned selling tobacco with pan masala So what did the companies do? They eliminated tobacco from pan masala Pan masala is a mixture of pan plus other ingredients That's why it sells with the name Kesar This is sold as a food item In fact The same organisation regulates pan masala that regulates biscuits Okay but it doesn't have tobacco, right? So if I eat pan masala what difference does it make? The secret is When you buy pan masala The local pan tapri person gives you a smaller secret packet This has the stuff people really want And after mixing this mixture in the pan masala you get mouth cancer Literally To experiment, I asked for pan masala And with this  I got this smaller packet as well Without me even asking him Running away from responsibility is something pan masala companies do well Because technically Their product does not have tobacco at all So this pack does not have a cancer warning Hiding behind this morale Big stars agree to promote this masala Of course If you're getting Rs. 5-10 crores who will say no? This style of advertising is called Making ads promoting alcohol is banned Alcohol companies market their club soda So that the brand image is intact They release music CDs So that you remember the brand name They run popular ad campaigns that you remember for years The product promoted in the ads is something you never buy anyway But yes, When you go to a liquor store You remember the brand name Similarly Pan masala brands sell silver coated elaichi The packaging matches the pan masala packaging But this is not mentioned in the ad Selling elaichi is not a crime  In fact, I saw a tea advertisement where the actress's dress resembled the product packaging This surrogate advertising has not spared any big actor Whether the actor is from Bollywood or the South Whether the actor is a new actor or established Wait wait wait So why am I making this video? People know this is bad for them People know stars lie in their ads People know that if they get cancer They can't afford its treatment If they are foolish So be it What difference does it make? It does make a difference when this foolishness takes lives of those who don't eat pan masala Official Covid deaths in India are 5 lakh But there is one disease which kills 5 lakh people every year This story repeats every year This disease is called TB (tuberculosis) Nobody talks about TB ever 1/3rd of the global cases come from India Why? Because just like Covid TB spreads because of droplets When an infected person sneezes, coughs or SPITS The infected droplets come out of their body and get exposed to air The question is Don't people abroad sneeze or cough? Of course they do But they don't spit A person chewing pan masala on an average spits 20-30 times every 10 minutes If he is a rickshaw driver who roams all over the city and if his body is infected with TB he can literally spread TB across a city He can get it to your house Without it being your fault It can ruin your life So what can we do about this At the beginning of this video, I shared how big the pan masala industry is The reason I shared it is because I want to question this industry If crores of rupees can be spent on ads If your ad has more than one star So from your total budget can a small amount be spent to teach people NOT TO SPIT Indian Railways spends Rs. 1200 crores every year only on cleaning spit stains By that logic who should be spending this money? Who takes responsibility for this loss? Your product Your industry's product Regardless of whether it has tobacco or not is destroying my country every single day The spitting person has NO SHAME Does the industry have some shame? Can this Rs. 41,000 crore industry spend 0.01% of their turnover on cleaning these dirty stains? We expect results from them But before that happens I brought about one change in MY behaviour In Mumbai before sitting in a rickshaw I ask the rickshaw driver one question Are you going to spit on the road? If he says yes or I see something in his mouth I don't sit in his rickshaw When I got this idea in my mind I thought I won't sit in a rickshaw again I won't find a single rickshaw driver I thought all rickshaw drivers were spitters I had to leave my rickshaw once or twice But I got another rickshaw immediately This achieves two goals Only those people get my money who don't drive after consuming addictive products It doesn't go to those people who use my money to buy these products The money goes to good people The good people get benefitted Plus this reduces the chance of me getting TB And the second benefit is People who spit get a reminder There are mad people like me who ask them questions If they end up having some guilt  let them feel guilty for dirtying the country Today, the problem is the people making a mistake are not being stopped by anyone There is nobody to ask them questions Even the police spit There is one thing for sure The people who are suffering get scared to tell the truth Why! My India is great People who write this behind their vehicles once the vehicle stops the people spit on the same country This is the bitter truth My last question is to you Will you pay those people who spit on your country? Will you support that industry that doesn't clean their own mess? Will you be excited for those actors films who have no idea that their actions cause cancer and TB in India If you found some sense in these questions Please share this video It is important these questions reach the people Tag your favourite actors, celebrities, influencers and ask them these questions People sat at home for 2 years because of the pandemic We thought at least now people will change People will not make the same mistakes that caused them financial hardship But I was wrong If you want oral cancer, go ahead Just DONT SPIT This message should reach every Indian Maybe one person can't make a difference But all of us together can make a big difference And there is a small difference in these lines That's the reason why It makes a difference!
